# show-password

:eyes: Need a peek at your hidden password? This Chrome extension can help.

This Chrome extension offers a helping hand for anyone who's ever struggled with remembering a password. It allows you to momentarily see the characters you've typed into a password field, instead of the usual obscured dots. This can be a lifesaver if you're unsure of a character or two, especially for complex passwords.

**This extension does not modify the underlying security of password fields.**
